# Quick Start Guide

This quick start guide gives a few example projects you can try
and suggests some actions you can do with GenomeView.
It is you have [installed GenomeView](README.md#installation) and you can start it.

## Get Demo Data
Download one of the following demo data sets for a quick start.
For some datasets there are also multiple formats and alignments available.
We have prepared B.anthracis, C.elegans and D.melanogaster for you.

### B. anthracis
  Download [B. anthracis basic dataset](https://software.broadinstitute.org/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/). This dataset includes the references sequence for Bacillus anthracis, as well as annotion of genes, rRNAs and tRNAs. Two sequencing data sets are included. One whole genome sequencing to discover variations and one RNA-seq data set*.
  
There are also two multiple alignments available. Both contain the same set of aligned species, but differ in format: 
  
* [multi-fasta format](https://software.broadinstitute.org/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/download/anthracis.mfa.gz) 
* [MAF format](https://software.broadinstitute.org/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/download/anthracis.maf.gz) 

The visualizations for both formats are slightly different. You can either download the files and load them from disk, or you can copy the URL and open the URL directly in GenomeView.

 
###  C. elegans
Download [C. elegans](https://software.broadinstitute.org/genomeview/demo/c_elegans/download/c_elegans.tar.gz). This basic data set includes the references sequence for C. elegans, as well as gene annotion. We also included an RNA-seq data set, both as individual reads and as a pileup track.
