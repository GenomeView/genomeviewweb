# Visualization

GenomeView is about visualizing genomes and properties of them.

This page describes how GenomeView does this.



Coverage refers to how many times, on average, each base in a reference genome or target region is read by sequencing reads. There are 
different standards for computing coverage, which one is used?

What are paired reads?
What is mapping to the forward/reverse strand for sense/anti-sense transcripts?
how does reads to cache work
