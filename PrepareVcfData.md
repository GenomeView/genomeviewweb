Preparing VCF data

VCF (Variant Call Format) is a text file format that contains meta-information lines, a header line, and then data lines each each containing information about genetic variation at a position in the genome.

## Data preparation

VCF files don't need to be indexed, but it is recommended to reduce their size with the tool [reducevcf](Reducevcf.md)
