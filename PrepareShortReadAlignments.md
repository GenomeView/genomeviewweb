# Prepare Short Read Alignments


Short read sequencing is a method used to determine the order of nucleotides (A,G,C,T) within DNA or RNA fragments. It involves breaking down genetic material into small pieces, typically ranging from 50 to 600 base pairs, which are then sequenced simultaneously.

To reconstruct the full genome from these small sequences, 
all pieces are matched and aligned with a known full sequence 
of a reference genome that has been sequenced in its entirity.
There must be sufficient overlap in the available sequences
to fill up the entire reference genome.


also called "Full BAM preparation instructions" sometimes
