# GenomeView User Manual

Welcome to the GenomeView User manual. These pages aim to answer any questions you may have as an end-user.

This documentation is open for anyone to contribute to, just click the edit-button near the top and you can help make this a better resource for everyone. Due to increasing vandalism we were forced to shutdown anonymous editing and account sign-up. If you like an account, please drop a note to support@genomeview.org.

Feel free to copy documentation from the old manual to here, there are still some pages that need to be transferred and we're happy with any help you can spare.
